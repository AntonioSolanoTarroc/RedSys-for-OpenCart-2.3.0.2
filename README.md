# RedSys-for-OpenCart-2.3.0.2
RedSys version 2.8 has been fixed to work on OpenCart 2.3.0.2. 
Files have been rearranged following new directories structure and internal references edited. 
Tested in clean version of OpenCart 2.3.0.2.
Althouth it shows a Permsission Denied while configuring it, it seems to work.
